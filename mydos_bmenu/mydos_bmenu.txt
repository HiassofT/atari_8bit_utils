"MyDos Binary Menu"

This program displays a menu of files and allows you to select one by
moving the highlighted bar with the joystick and firing on the
selected entry.  If the file is a MyDos subdirectory, a menu for
that directory is displayed.  If the file is a drive specification
(D1: through D3: are displayed as the first three entries), then
the root directory is used to display a menu.

Whatever directory is displayed is used as the default directory
when the program is loaded.

The '.exe' file is the result of compiling the BASIC program using
the ABC compiler.  This means that you can select DOS by hitting
break (you may have to move the joystick before the program
notices the keypress) and then using the ABC menu.
